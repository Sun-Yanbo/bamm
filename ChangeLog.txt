        Change: Previously, numerical tolerance parameter MAX_E_PROB was
        defined as a macro in SpExModel.cpp with a default setting of 0.999.
        This is now an optional (usually not specified) parameter that can be
        changed in the control file or commmand line. This was necessary
        because a large dataset with highly incomplete sampling was getting
        non-finite initial likelihoods. The problem was solved after increasing
        the parameter to 0.9999. The new name is "ExtinctionProbMax".

        Change: If the simulate priors option is turned on, priors will be
        simulated after the MCMC has run, not before (as it did previously).

        Bug fix: In some systems, BAMM will not compile because the exit()
        method was not recognized. Fixed by including cstdlib in the relevant
        files.

        Bug fix: Prior values were not computed correctly for the root event.

        Feature: Any parameter in the control file can now be overriden by a
        command-line argument. The argument must start with "--", followed by
        the name of the parameter (as it is written in the control file),
        followed by a space, and finally followed by the new value.

        Feature: Separate priors may be specified for the root event.

        Bug fix: Log-likelihood was not updated after adding an event, causing
        the wrong log-likelihood to be reported.

        Bug fix: Error message "problem in BranchHistory::getLastEvent()"
        followed by a segmentation fault. Fixed by deleting the object pointed
        to by an iterator before erasing the iterator in the event collection.
