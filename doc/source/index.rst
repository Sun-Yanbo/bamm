Welcome
=======

BAMM (Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixtures) is a program for
modeling complex dynamics of speciation, extinction, and trait evolution on
phylogenetic trees.

BAMM is oriented entirely towards detecting and quantifying heterogeneity in
evolutionary rates. It uses reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo to
automatically explore a vast universe of candidate models of lineage
diversification and trait evolution. It has been described and extended in
several publications (`Rabosky et al. 2012
<http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2013/130606/ncomms2958/full/ncomms2958.html>`_,
`Rabosky 2014
<http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0089543>`_).
BAMM is a command line program written in
C++. Post-run analysis and visualization is performed using the R package
**BAMMtools**.
