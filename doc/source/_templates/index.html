<p>
BAMM (Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixtures) is a program for
modeling complex dynamics of speciation, extinction, and trait evolution on
phylogenetic trees.
</p>

<p>
BAMM is oriented entirely towards detecting and quantifying heterogeneity in
evolutionary rates. It uses reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo to
automatically explore a vast universe of candidate models of lineage
diversification and trait evolution. It has been described and extended in
several publications (<a href="http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2013/130606/ncomms2958/full/ncomms2958.html">Rabosky et al. 2012</a>,
<a href="http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0089543">Rabosky 2014</a>).
BAMM is a command line program written in
C++. Post-run analysis and visualization is performed using the R package
<b>BAMMtools</b>.
