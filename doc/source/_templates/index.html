<p>
BAMM (Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixtures) is a program for
modeling complex dynamics of speciation, extinction, and trait evolution on
phylogenetic trees.
</p>

<p>
BAMM is oriented entirely towards detecting and quantifying heterogeneity in
evolutionary rates. It uses reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo to
automatically explore a vast universe of candidate models of lineage
diversification and trait evolution. It has been described and extended in
several publications (citations). BAMM is a command line program written in
C++. Post-run analysis and visualization is performed using the R package
<b>BAMMtools</b>.
