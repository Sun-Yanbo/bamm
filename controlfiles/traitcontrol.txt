#
#   BAMM control file for speciation-extinction analysis 
#
#   General Format: 
#       - Whitespace (tabs and spaces) is not important
#         and is stripped out when this file is parsed.
#       - Each parameter is specified as: par_name = par_value
#         where par_name is the name of the parameter
#         and par_value is the value you are assigning it.
#       - Parameter names must be spelled exactly.
#       - Comments start with # and go to the end of the line
#       - True/False parameters (e.g., runMCMC) are specified
#       - with "1" (True) or "0" (False).

# GENERAL SETUP AND DATA INPUT

modeltype = trait
# Specify speciationextinction or trait analysis

treefile = ../examples/traits/skinkshape/skinks183.tre
# Location of phylogenetic tree to be analyzed

traitfile = ../examples/traits/skinkshape/skinks_shape.txt
# Location of phenotypic traits

runInfoFilename = run_info.txt
# File name to output general information about this run

sampleFromPriorOnly = 0
# If TRUE will perform BAMM analysis sampling 
# from prior only. (no likelihoods computed)

# autotune = 0 # Not supported for traits
# Experimental option for tuning MCMC operators

runMCMC = 1
# perform an MCMC simulation? If runMCMC = 0, the program will 
# check whether the data file can be read and whether 
# an initial likelihood can be computed.

loadEventData = 0
# Load event configuration - see Documentation

eventDataInfile = eventconfig2.txt
# Used only if loadEventData = 1

initializeModel = 1
# Initializes (but does not run) the MCMC. If initializeModel = 0, 
# will just check parameter file and also ensure that data (treefile etc) 
# can be read.

# PRIORS

rootPrior = 1.0

poissonRatePrior = 10
# The rate parameter of the exponential prior on the rate parameter of the 
# Poisson process. Smaller values favor greater numbers of distinct evolutionary
# regimes on tree. 
# Suggested values: 
#     poissonRatePrior = 1.0 # for smaller datasets (< 500 tips)
#     poissonRatePrior = 0.1 or even 0.02 for large (5000+ tips)

branchRatesWriteFreq = 20000
# Writes file with branch-specific mean rates every
# branchRatesWriteFreq generations. 
# These rates should generally be computed directly
# from the event data (see BAMMtools functions), 
# but for very large trees, it can be convenient to work
# with the branch rates.

mcmcWriteFreq = 5000
# Writes MCMC simulation parameters (log-likelihood, log-prior,
# number of processes) to file every mcmcWriteFreq generations.

eventDataWriteFreq = 10000
# Specify frequency to write actual model parameters to file. 
# These are the main results!

# Prints accept frequency

printFreq = 20000
# Prints MCMC status to screen every printFreq generations.

overwrite = 0
# If TRUE will overwrite analysis result files (if present).
# Default is set to FALSE: analyses will stop before overwriting files.

# Name of analysis (output files will be prefixed with this)

# information about MCMC simulation (log-likelihoods etc)
