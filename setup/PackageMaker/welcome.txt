Welcome to the BAMM installation program.

BAMM (Bayesian Analysis of Macroevolutionary Mixtures) is an NSF-funded program for modeling complex dynamics of speciation, extinction, and trait evolution on phylogenetic trees. BAMM is oriented entirely towards detecting and quantifying heterogeneity in evolutionary rates. It uses reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo to automatically explore a vast universe of candidate models of lineage diversification and trait evolution. BAMM is a command-line program and should be run using the Terminal application. Post-run analysis and visualization is performed using the R package BAMMtools. For more information on BAMM and how to use it, please visit http://bamm-project.org.

This program will guide you through the installation of BAMM.
