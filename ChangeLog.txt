        Bug fix: Prior values were not computed correctly for the root event.

        Feature: Any parameter in the control file can now be overriden by a
        command-line argument. The argument must start with "--", followed by
        the name of the parameter (as it is written in the control file),
        followed by a space, and finally followed by the new value.

        Feature: Separate priors may be specified for the root event.

        Bug fix: Log-likelihood was not updated after adding an event, causing
        the wrong log-likelihood to be reported.

        Bug fix: Error message "problem in BranchHistory::getLastEvent()"
        followed by a segmentation fault. Fixed by deleting the object pointed
        to by an iterator before erasing the iterator in the event collection.
